"""Test configuration

This conftest.py file is the first loaded by pytest when the tests are executed,
see the documentation for more infos :
https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.2.x/reference/fixtures.html#conftest-py-sharing-fixtures-across-multiple-files

We use it to :
- create a test model
- create a TestClient named test_base_client which does not load the test model
- create a TestClient named test_complete_client which does load the test model
- set some environment variables to check if they are well set in the app settings

> More details about test_base_client and test_complete_client:
>
> By default a TestClient does not fire events so the startup and shutdown events are never fired
> and the model is never loaded.
> We can fire thoses events by using TestClient as a context manager so we use two TestClient in
> our tests : a test_base_client that does not load the model and test_complete_client that does
> load the model thanks to a context manager. It allows us to test the behavior of our application
> when a model is not loaded (which should not happend).
