"""This module contains the base Model class

Model is the base model class. It contains a loading and downloading methods that are
used by default to download your model into your Docker container and load it into your
application.

To use a custom model class in your application, create a new module such as
model_awesome.py in this package and write a custom class that overwrite _load_model,
download_model or predict depending on your needs.
