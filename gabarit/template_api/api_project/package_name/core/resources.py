"""Resources for the FastAPI application

This module define resources that need to be instantiated at startup in a global
variable resources that can be used in routes.

This is the way your machine learning models can be loaded in memory at startup
so they can handle requests.

To use your own model instead of the base model, create a module in {{package_name}}.model
such as model_awesome.py and import it as Model instead of the one used here.
