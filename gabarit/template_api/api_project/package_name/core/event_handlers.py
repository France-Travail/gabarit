"""Startup and Stop handlers for FastAPI application

This module define event handlers and n particular startup and stop handlers that
are used to instantiate your model when the API first start.

To use your own model instead of the base model, create a module in {{package_name}}.model
such as model_awesome.py and import it as Model instead of the one used here.
